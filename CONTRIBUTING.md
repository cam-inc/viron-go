```

#### Setting Up the Application
##### Installing dependencies with task
```
$ task install
```

##### Running go mod tidy
```
$ task tidy
```

#### Running Tests
```
$ task test
```

Below is a simple guide for contributing code:

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch with a meaningful name suitable for the task from the `main` branch.
3. Run the following command to set up: `go mod tidy`.
4. Push the branch.
5. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.

#### Managing Versions
To make the version recognizable by Go Modules, you need to tag it in Git. Always use the format vX.Y.Z ([Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org)).

[Module version numbering](https://go.dev/doc/modules/version-numbers)
```
Example:

To tag v1.0.0:

git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

üìå Note

The tag name must include the `v` prefix (e.g., v1.2.3). Go Modules detects this and uses the version as a module.

#### Using the Library in Other Projects
To use this library in another Go project, use `go get`.
```
Example: go get github.com/cam-inc/viron-go@v1.0.0

Import it as usual:

import "github.com/cam-inc/viron-go/lib/domains"
```

#### Versions v2 and Beyond
For major versions v2 and later, Go Modules requires special handling. The directory name and module path must include the version.

[Go Modules: v2 and Beyond](https://go.dev/blog/v2-go-modules)
```
Example:

Module name: github.com/cam-inc/viron-go/v2
Directory structure: github.com/cam-inc/viron-go/v2/domains
Command to execute:

go mod init github.com/cam-inc/viron-go/v2

git tag v2.0.0

go get github.com/cam-inc/viron-go/v2@v2.0.0
```

#### Release Workflow
[Module release and versioning workflow](https://go.dev/doc/modules/release-workflow)

The release workflow for custom Go (Golang) libraries (assuming GitHub integration) can be designed as follows. This ensures that version-controlled code is correctly released and usable by external projects with Go Modules.

**üîÅ General Release Workflow**

1. Implement and test features on a development branch.
2. Merge into the `main` branch.
3. Decide on the version number (Semantic Versioning).
4. Add a Git tag (Go Modules compatible).
5. Create a GitHub release (optional).
6. Import and use with `go get` in other projects.

**üìå Detailed Steps**

- ‚ë† Development and Testing
  - Add features or fix bugs on branches (e.g., feature/xxx, fix/yyy) and validate with unit tests or CI.

- ‚ë° Merge into the `main` Branch
  - After review (e.g., via Pull Requests), merge into the `main` branch to complete the milestone.

- ‚ë¢ Decide the Version
  - Feature addition ‚Üí Minor update (v1.1.0 ‚Üí v1.2.0)
  - Bug fixes only ‚Üí Patch update (v1.2.3 ‚Üí v1.2.4)
  - Breaking changes ‚Üí Major update (v1.x.x ‚Üí v2.0.0)

- ‚ë£ Tag and Release
  - Create a tag via CLI (always include `v`):
    ```
    git tag v1.2.0
    git push origin v1.2.0

    This allows Go Modules to recognize the tag as a version.
    ```

- ‚ë§ Write Release Notes on GitHub (Optional)
  - Use GitHub UI or CLI (`gh release`) to add release notes, making changes clear to users.
    ```
    Example:

    gh release create v1.2.0 --title "v1.2.0 Release" --notes "This release includes new features and bug fixes."
    ```
